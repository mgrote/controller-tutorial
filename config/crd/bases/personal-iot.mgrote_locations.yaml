                      number of items returned, and indicates that the server has
                      more data available. The value is opaque and may be used to
                      issue another request to the endpoint that served this list
                      to retrieve the next set of available objects. Continuing a
                      consistent list may not be possible if the server configuration
                      has changed or more than a few minutes have passed. The resourceVersion
                      field returned when using this continue value will be identical
                      to the value in the first response, unless you have received
                      this token from an error message.

                  remainingItemCount:
                    description: remainingItemCount is the number of subsequent items
                      in the list which are not included in this list response. If
                      the list request contained label or field selectors, then the
                      number of remaining items is unknown and the field will be left
                      unset and omitted during serialization. If the list is complete
                      (either because it is not chunking or because this is the last
                      chunk), then there are no more remaining items and this field
                      will be left unset and omitted during serialization. Servers
                      older than v1.15 do not set this field. The intended use of
                      the remainingItemCount is *estimating* the size of a collection.
                      Clients should not rely on the remainingItemCount to be set
                      or to be exact.
